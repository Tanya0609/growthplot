#Summary
growthplot is a project made for the App4Kids Hackathon event. It uses the Python Django web framework and allows parents to upload children's measurement data.


#Setup
1. Install Python on your machine. You can find the latest version [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. (Optional) Install [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/) and [mod_wsgi](http://www.modwsgi.org/)
3. (Optional) Start the database. 
4. If you are using MaxOSX or Linux, type the command `sudo pip install Django` to install Django framework.
5. If you are using Windows, use the [standalone pip installer] (http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html#install-pip) to install Django framework
6. Check if Django has been installed successfully by typing the command `$ python -c "import django; print(django.get_version())"` (remove $ if you are using Windows) in the terminal (console for Windows). The terminal should inform you about the current version of Django. If you get the message "No module named django" then reinstall it.
