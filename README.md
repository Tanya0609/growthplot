Project for App4Kids Hackathon

This project uses Pythons Django web framework. Ensure that you have Python installed on your computer.

##Installation instructions for Django 1.8:
To install Django you can use Python's package manager `pip`:
* If you're using MacOSX or Linux, in your terminal you can use the command `sudo pip install Django` to install the framework in your Python's installation directory.
* [This page](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/install/#installing-official-release) has more specifc installation instructions for your particular OS (for example if you're using Windows)
* You can check if Django successfully installed by entering `$ python -c "import django; print(django.get_version())"` in your terminal. You should see your currently installed version of Django at the prompt. If Django did not successfully install you will see a message like `“No module named django”`
